# Abstract
Since the earliest days of board and digital gaming, experience points (XP)
have been the de facto currency of in-game life. As a character goes
through their narrow world, they gain XP which can be used to “level up” and
improve statistics or function.
XP, the decentralized cryptocurrency, aims to introduce this function into life
in a way that makes it both simple and intuitive to build XP rewards into daily
living. Whether it is through the mechanism of XP being given as a reward for
game play, as it would be used in a more conventional sense, or XP being
given as a component of the gamification of reality, the practice of
awarding XP for use in the real world presents a tangible solution to some of
the problems endemic to today’s somewhat abstract and disconnected
reality. Through building this bridge between a user’s everyday life and the
blockchain-based world of XP, a new and brighter future blending
cryptocurrency and life can be built. 

# Note for Experienced Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts
As this paper is designed to not only introduce people to XP, but also to
cryptocurrency in general, some experienced readers may find certain
segments to be slow-going, boring, or overly simplified. Because of the
fundamentally world-changing potential exhibited by the XP ecosystem, it is
important that non-crypto people can read and understand what is
proposed by the XP Development Team. Many of the ideas presented in this
introductory whitepaper will be further fleshed out in technical yellow papers
at a later date.
As this paper was designed for non-crypto people as well as cryptocurrency
enthusiasts, if you would like to skip some of the basic information and get
straight to the groundbreaking proposals, please skip directly to Section V. 

# Why XP?
The true value of a life isn’t measured in money or in age or in things – life is
measured in experience. A life well lived is filled with infinite grains of
experience that set it apart from every other. Living to the ripe old age of 100
years in a bubble is no life at all, but going out in a blaze of glory in your mid20s
while doing something amazing can be considered a “life well lived.”
While not advocating the mid-20s blaze of glory path, there is something to
be said for experience. Life is meant to be lived – fully.
Everything we do in life gives us experience. Each trip we take, each concert
we attend, and each new friend we meet, contributes to the eternal
distributed ledger of our lives. Why not use this experience? Why not find a
way to account for it and to make it work for us as we go through life? Why
not meet with others, who also have experience, and share another unique
experience together. This sharing economy of experience is what XP was
created to facilitate.
The central requirement of XP is that it is for everyone. Unlike other
cryptocurrencies that have a specific and very narrow usage, XP is designed
to be used by anyone, anywhere. With a mechanism that can provide a
degree of distribution impossible with other cryptocurrencies, XP can
enhance your life and bring you closer to the experience-driven community.
Unlike other cryptocurrencies which must be purchased or mined, XP can be
made available to you as you build experience. XP is one of life’s tiny rewards
that you get for a job well done or a new experience tucked away. XP opens
the potential for an entire economy based on what you have done, where
you have gone, and the communities with which you engage.
Before we begin, it is important for potential users to understand the use case
of XP. With most cryptocurrencies, the use case is hypothetical. Often, this use
case itself is in development and it MAY be available for use at some point in
time in the future. With XP, the use case already exists, because people are
out there in the world building experience every single day.
The term XP was first used by Gygax, Kaye, and Blume, the original creators of
Dungeons and Dragons. Since that time has become ubiquitous in many
different areas of life. The trend towards gamification has allowed the
concept of “experience points,” once reserved for games, to spread into
tasks from doing your laundry to walking your dog. XP seeks to capitalize on
this by providing an incentivization structure to permit the free flow of tokens
from generation points to users and back to spending partners.
