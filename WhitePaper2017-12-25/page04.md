## II. Understanding Market Sizing
There is a large contingent of the cryptocurrency investment community which associates the price of a cryptocurrency with its supply.
However, this logic is somewhat faulty, as it isn’t necessarily the supply of a token which determines its price,
but rather demand and usage. We are dedicated to building that demand and creating that usage.

And now for some brief notes about market sizing:

### In Gaming:
* In 2016, gaming represented a total market valuation of US$99.6 billion, with an 8.5% growth rate over 2015[2]
* 58% of all growth in gaming in 2016 occurred in the Asia-Pacific Region

### In Tourism:
* In Europe, tours and activities account for around US$40 billion annually[3]
* Travelers are likely to spend more on sightseeing and building experience than on shopping, souvenirs and nightlife combined[4]

### In Entertainment:
* Total box office receipts for movies globally was $38.3 billion in 2015, up 5% over 2014’s total5
* In 2016, there was over 60.4% growth in streaming revenue for the music industry[6]

### In Social Media:
* There are over 800 million active Instagram users globally, with over 500 million daily users[7]
* In the year of 2015, 6,917,000 visitors stopped in at the Eiffel Tower in Paris8

There has been no single means of incentivizing action across and between each of these different ecosystems – until XP

# In XP’s Current Ecosystem:
* There are 232 known peers as of December 22nd, 20179

The dramatic use case for XP is clear
