Meet Hugo – Hugo is a cutting-edge chef in New York City.
He believes that a meal at his restaurant should be an experience.
In light of this, he was delighted to discover that he could set up a retail sales node in his restaurant.
Now, at the bottom of each of his receipts, a private key is printed which allows his customers to redeem XP.
When you experience his fusion take on chicken Cordon Bleu you get 1000 XP as a reminder of your visit.

Meet Htet Oo – Htet Oo operates an elephant tour company located in the jungles of Myanmar.
He is thrilled to run a retail salesnode because it gives him the opportunity to attract international customers
who are interested in touring the world and using XP.
For each of his elephant rides, for which he receives XP, a more stable alternative to the Burmese Kyat,
he offers XP in exchange for social media posts on his customers Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts.
He operates both a retail sales node, and his own personal master node.
He also uses his mobile wallet to pay guides and service providers along his tour routes.

Devnodes: As our digital lives grow, there is much we will be able to do in terms of digital content delivery and digital life integration.
While the following cases could apply right now, more and more use cases spring into existence daily.

Meet ThePinkCrypto – ThePinkCrypto operates a chatroom and wants to use XP as an in-chat tipping currency.
To facilitate this, the XP foundation provides her with an application Dev no,
which provides some degree of liquidity for rains, thereby incentivizing channel participation, but also acts as an additional security node on the network.

Meet Loopylew113 – Loopylew is the developer of Forest Siege, an indie game available on itch.io.
He uses an application Devnode in forest siege because it allows him to rain XP on players for performing specific tasks within the game.
This connects directly to an in-game wallet, which will enable players to store XP to purchase in-game items, or send the XP to their own core wallet.
As time goes on he intends on building an entirely enclosed marketplace based on XP within the forest siege game.

Meet Yaneli - Yaneli is an app developer who focuses on the creation of health-based applications.
In exchange for using her meal planning application, users are awarded XP for each item they enter into their daily meal plan.
This XP incentivizes people to use her applications, making them more attractive in an open market.
However, it also makes her applications much more effective because of the effect that the positive enforcement from gamification offers.
