## IV. The Economics of Digital Token-Based System
Due to the fact that it is our long-term goal to push XP out into the world and beyond the cryptocurrency community, it is important that we address some of the fundamental concerns presented by the uninitiated.
This segment was borne out of a discussion with several bankers who raised several points about which they were concerned.
The Liquidity Problem: This issue, as it has been thus termed for Bitcoin, is essentially the challenges facing conversion from Bitcoin to more easily usable fiat currency.
This problem of the essential fungibility has been dealt with, in large part, by the growth of the market.
If viewed as an investment instrument,
such as a bond, then the conversion of Bitcoin to cash presents barriers no greater than a certificate of deposit or any other paper-based asset.
However, if viewed as a store of value and currency in its own right, cryptocurrency doesn’t need to be “converted,” it simply needs to be used.
Around the world, it is becoming more and more possible to USE cryptocurrency without being concerned about the fundamental ability to instantly convert to fiat. In many ways,
cryptocurrencies present a great opportunity of global functionality which national currencies do not possess.

That said, if you must convert a cryptocurrency to cash, there are:
* Cryptocurrency exchanges which can direct deposit funds into your bank account based on cryptocurrency deposits
* Crypto-based banking institutions
* Bitcoin ATMs or other automated banking services available to cryptocurrency users

Decentralization and the Lack of Oversight:
This is an issue of special concern to many financial experts.
There is a great need amongst adherents to the financial institutions of today for some sort of centralization and control.
The fear is that without centralized control and oversight, there can be no sort of Keynesian economic controls exerted on the system.
While this is technically true with most cryptocurrency systems, most cryptocurrency users would consider this very much a feature, and not a bug.
Having state-sponsored oversight guarantees only that meddling will occur.
The system cannot be self-correcting because market conditions often act in opposition to attempts to control the market creating a negative oscillatory cycle.

Cryptocurrencies DO lack a central control system, but that also means that they cannot be manipulated outside of the application of market forces.
This is a double-edged sword because on one hand it means that the users themselves retain control over their own resources.
On the other hand, it means that market forces CAN be used to lead to market movements.
This is no different than the more standard financial models,
but the scale of many cryptocurrencies mean that it is easier to move the value of cryptocurrencies than it is to move the value of, for example, the dollar.
It is expected that as usage increases and a token such as XP moves from the hands of those who speculate to the hands of those who actually use the token,
these fluctuations will decrease, and a market equilibrium will be achieved based on growth and usage.
Black Market Usage: It has often been said by critics that the only reason cryptocurrencies exist is to conduct black market transactions.
While this is certainly possible, cash and metals will always be king for large-scale illicit transactions.
The very fact that transactions exists on a blockchain which is immutable and a permanent record that movement has taken place makes blockchain transactions unattractive for anything illegal on a large scale.
Blockchain forensics is a growing area of law enforcement interest, and the days of using cryptocurrencies to move large amounts of money completely undetected are coming to an end.
