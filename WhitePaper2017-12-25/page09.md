### Devnodes
Unlike their relatives, the Retail Salesnodes, Application Devnodes exist to facilitate online growth of the XP economy.
These Devnodes are provided, free of charge, to developers.
They stake at a very high rate, but operate on a 10-day moving average coinburn.
Essentially, if a developer has a game that is very popular, it is vital to be able to provide XP to be rained into their ecosystem.
However, to prevent accumulation or manipulation, these nodes will burn coins that have not been used after ten days.
These nodes can only be accessed through the to-be-created XPlay API, and are otherwise inaccessible.
Like the Retail Salesnodes, they function as a coin burn when created, and cannot be broken and sold.
Likewise, their staked coins cannot be directly accessed, but only distributed using the XPlay API.

### Geonodes
One of the critical differentiating features that XP can offer to the world,
is the ability for users to gain XP simply by visiting certain locations.
Using the android-based XP wallet, with planned iPhone integration in the future,
users can activate location tracking on their wallets, which will enable them to receive geolocation based rains.
This works by making it possible for a retail location, a monument or a museum to offer experience points to their visitors by simply notifying
them that experience points are available and offering a QR code for them to download the wallet.
Imagine being able to attend a concert
â€“ As you listen to the music, your phone receives a rain of XP from a local promotional partner.
You are then able to turn around and use this XP to buy refreshments from an XP affiliated retailer.
The possibilities are endless with Geonodes and XP is the first crypto currency to offer this feature.

The XP Foundation Mothernode:
While not a staking node and while serving a very different purpose,
the XP Mothernode is the central and auditable clearing house for the stake percentages returned to The XP Foundation.
The XP Mothernode serves primarily for the creation of the preceding node types (with the exception of Masternodes and Supernodes).
The XP Mothernode is entirely transparent and can be audited by anyone. To fund this node,
a portion of all stake rewards are sent back to the XP Foundation Mothernode to be used in ecosystem growth.

This node functions on a 30-day moving average and burns all tokens which have been sent it they have not been used in 30 days.
This prevents accumulation by the development team and altogether avoids the problem created by previous developers.
The continuous burn will prevent undue supply inflation,
but will also allow for the creation of Retail Salesnodes and Application Devnodes as needed to onboard new retail locations and developers.
