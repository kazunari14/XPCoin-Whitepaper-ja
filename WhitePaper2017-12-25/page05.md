## III. What is XP?
XP, or eXperience Points, is a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency.
Since XP is designed to be used by a much broader audience, it would do well to spend some time explaining exactly what this means.
While much deeper explanations can be found in many different locations online,
a brief hypercondensed explanation of exactly what a cryptocurrency is and how it is generated follows.
The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was developed by a person, or persons, known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
This cryptocurrency, in a stroke, revolutionized the financial world.
One characteristic that makes cryptocurrency so revolutionary is because it removes the requirement for faith in a financial system.
If you have a dollar in your wallet, you know that dollar will buy you a set amount of bread or water.
You know this because that dollar is backed by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States,
which is, in turn, backed by the United States Government and everything that entails.
However, history has taught us again and again that banks fail, governments collapse, localized computer systems fail,
and operator error can wipe out the financial records of millions.
With decentralized currencies, this isn’t possible.
With cryptocurrency, you don’t need to trust any single person or organization, instead you can know,
with mathematical certainty, that your deposits are secured and protected by the entire distributed network.
Proof-of-Work (PoW) currencies rely on computers to perform complex calculation to secure the network.
While this seemed like a good idea at the advent of cryptocurrencies, as difficulty increases it is becoming clear that it
is environmentally irresponsible and wholly unnecessary to rely on these sorts of arbitrary calculations to generate new tokens or to secure the network.
As a replacement for PoW, XP uses a system known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to defend the network.
This also makes the generation of tokens possible by anyone who maintains a coin balance and keeps their computer on;
it does not require a powerful computer or expensive GPUs to “mine” coins.
From a network security perspective, this makes a difference as well.
As computing power advances and quantum computers begin to edge their way out of theory and into actual usage,
PoW currencies are going to become much less reliable as the security of the network depends on no single actor being able to control a majority of the processing power being used.
In the event that one state actor makes an advance in quantum processing, it would be possible for this state actor to attack the very core of PoW currencies.
On the other hand, in order to destabilize the network with a PoS currency, it is necessary for the hostile actor to control over 50% of the available coin supply.
This is much less likely than someone attempting to successfully destabilize a PoW network.
