## Note for Experienced Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts
As this paper is designed to not only introduce people to XP, but also to crypto currency in general, some experienced readers may find certain segments to be slow-going, boring, or overly simplified.
Because of the fundamentally world-changing potential exhibited by the XP ecosystem, it is important that non-crypto people can read and understand what is proposed by the XP Development Team.
Many of the ideas presented in this introductory whitepaper will be further fleshed out in technical yellow papers at a later date.

As this paper was designed for non-crypto people as well as cryptocurrency enthusiasts,
if you would like to skip some of the basic information and get straight to the groundbreaking proposals, please skip directly to Section V.
