## I. Why XP?
The true value of a life isn’t measured in money or in age or in things – life is measured in experience.
A life well lived is filled with infinite grains of experience that set it apart from every other.
Living to the ripe old age of 100 years in a bubble is no life at all,
but going out in a blaze of glory in your mid20s while doing something amazing can be considered a “life well lived.”
While not advocating the mid-20s blaze of glory path, there is something to be said for experience. Life is meant to be lived – fully.
Everything we do in life gives us experience.
Each trip we take, each concert we attend, and each new friend we meet, contributes to the eternal distributed ledger of our lives.
Why not use this experience? Why not find a way to account for it and to make it work for us as we go through life?
Why not meet with others, who also have experience, and share another unique experience together.
This sharing economy of experience is what XP was created to facilitate.
The central requirement of XP is that it is for everyone.
Unlike other cryptocurrencies that have a specific and very narrow usage, XP is designed to be used by anyone, anywhere.
With a mechanism that can provide a degree of distribution impossible with other cryptocurrencies,
XP can enhance your life and bring you closer to the experience-driven community.
Unlike other cryptocurrencies which must be purchased or mined, XP can be made available to you as you build experience.
XP is one of life’s tiny rewards that you get for a job well done or a new experience tucked away.
XP opens the potential for an entire economy based on what you have done, where you have gone, and the communities with which you engage.
Before we begin, it is important for potential users to understand the use case of XP.
With most cryptocurrencies, the use case is hypothetical.
Often, this use case itself is in development and it MAY be available for use at some point in time in the future. With XP, the use case already exists,
because people are out there in the world building experience every single day.
The term XP was first used by Gygax, Kaye, and Blume, the original creators of Dungeons and Dragons.[1]
Since that time has become ubiquitous in many different areas of life. The trend towards gamification has allowed the concept of “experience points,” once reserved for games,
to spread into tasks from doing your laundry to walking your dog.
XP seeks to capitalize on this by providing an incentivization structure to permit the free flow of tokens from generation points to users and back to spending partners.
