## V. The State of XP Today
The XP community has raised several concerns regarding XP’s fundamental technology and market distribution.
There is often comments about reducing total supply, reducing stake rate (the first stage of which has been done with the December 25th, 2017 Wallet Release), and large wallets held by previous team members.
While a great deal could be said about these issues, it is best to simply present the solution.
All of these issues can be effectively managed through the introduction of the XP Pentanode System.
Rather than relying on simple staking for the security of the network, XP will rely on five different types of specialized nodes to provide network security and the verification of transactions.
In addition to receiving various annual returns, the nodes will also send a percentage of their stake rewards back to the XP Foundation to be used to grow the network or to be burnt in a transparent and auditable fashion.
NOTE: The XP Pentanode System currently proposed has been input into the
Official 2018 XP Roadmap. However, as development continues, these details may change.

### XP Masternodes (Cost: 50m XP)
These are standard investment-grade Masternodes, paying out at roughly 50% annually.
In order to guarantee uptime, stakes will occur every 60 minutes after the node has been active.
Annual earnings assume a 24/7 uptime, with bonuses being distributed to nodes for being up and staking for the longest period of time.
For each hour staking, these nodes will receive approximately 2,800 XP.
The nodes will be configured so that It doesn’t matter whether the node holds 50m or 500m, the payment will be the same.
This incentivizes the creation of new nodes and disincentivizes hoarding.
