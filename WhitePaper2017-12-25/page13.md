Integrating Advertising with the XP Network using Geonodes:
The primary goal of XP has always been to attempt to find a way to incentivize what is good in the human experience,
and reward people for their involvement in a broader global extra national network.
XP is continuously looking for ways to enhance our offerings to humanity.
One such way we can do this is through leveraging the XP network to fund various social and environmental projects.
The way that we do this is by offering advertising placement in the XP Mobile Wallet which is based on the geographic location of an XP user.[11]
This will make it possible for the XP Foundation to sell advertising space to hand selected companies and direct a large portion of the proceeds from this advertising to preservation efforts.
For example, an XP user in Yosemite National Park may receive an advertisement for North face apparel, partnered with rain from a Geonode.
For the first time, this creates a mechanism that both allows the delivery of advertising content to the enduser,
incentivizes the end-user to acknowledge the advertising company, and simultaneously works to preserve the National Park system with advertising revenue.
This concept is still under development, and will be explored in greater depth in a later publication.

### VII. Conclusion
This is just the beginning of what XP can accomplish. 2018 is to be a year of capacity building and ecosystem growth.
The XP Team looks forward to the continued support of the XP Community as we work to make XP the worldâ€™s premier experience-based currency in gaming, sports, academics, and every other area of life.

XP: Do it for the experience!

11 This will, of course, only work for an XP user who has gone into their wallet and activated the location reporting so that they can receive geo-rains.
