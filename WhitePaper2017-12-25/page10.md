## VI. A Brighter Future with XP
The critical roadblock for all cryptocurrency units today is answering the
question of how to drive adoption. Currently, to buy XP, a user has several
avenues, but most of them involve buying some crypto of one sort or another
and moving it to an exchange to buy some XP. This is not sustainable and
locks out the vast majority of potential users who are uncomfortable with
cryptocurrency in general, and are abjectly terrified of exchanges, with all of
their elaborate bells, whistles, candles, and unfamiliar terminology.
The solution to this is to create an ecosystem that is based on a regular
distribution of tokens in amounts that incentivize user engagement while not
over-inflating the currency or disincentivizing purchases on exchanges by the
investor class. The overall idea is to help people see the utility of XP, so that
they will go out on their own to acquire more – either by supporting XP
affiliates or through purchasing XP on an exchange.
This can be done in a variety of ways:
The most reliable source of XP for the average user should always be the
holders of the Salesnode and Devnodes. As a currency, we serve more than
one purpose; in addition to serving as a medium of exchange, XP serves as
an able vehicle of incentivization for customers, clients, and visitors
everywhere.

Salesnodes: While there are hundreds of use cases, consider these few examples of holders of Salesnodes using them to grow their businesses.

Meet BloodyEwe – BloodyEwe operates xp.market and uses it to sell Steam codes and other XP-related merchandise (really! Go check it out!).
In addition to selling these codes, he would like to be able to establish a referral system so that when someone sends their friends to buy Steam codes with XP, BloodyEwe can give some XP back to the referrer.

Meet Jan – Jan is a travel agent who uses XP to incentivize specific trips.
The Salesnode enables Jan to functionally give discounts on a trip while not negatively impacting her bottom line.
Jan recently gave 50m XP to Barclay for the purchase of a trip to Thailand, and also provided him with a list of retail locations and places where XP can be spent.
The XP was sent to Barclay’s XP Mobile Wallet where he will be able to spend It at participating retailers in Bangkok.
