Meet Fon – Fon is a developer for an online education based website, at which students can sign up for classes, watch videos, and participate in online forum discussions.
By maintaining an application Devnode, Fon can provide experience points to her end-users.
If you sign up to take her class on blockchain technology, you will receive 5 million XP on completion.

Geonodes: The first geographically-based cryptocurrency reward system gives the average user a way to earn XP without having to spend anything at all to purchase XP,
but still contributes to the ecosystem by patronizing local landmarks such as those below.

Meet John Harvard - The famous statue of John Harvard sits in the quad at Harvard College.
As a sort of mecca for those seeking Ivy League acceptances, the figure of John Harvard is a frequent location visited by hundreds of thousands of people every year.
With an XP Geonode, an educational consultancy can rain XP on visitors to the statue of John Harvard. These visitors,
can in turn use XP at various locations throughout Boston and around the world.

Meet Big Ben – No postcard of London would be complete without the iconic image of Big Ben looming in the background.
A tour company in London could identify a specific location for an XP Geonode,
which would rain XP on visitors who came to take photos with Big Ben in the background.
This XP could then be used to purchase discounts on double-decker bus rides throughout London, provided by the same tour operator.

Meet Mount Everest – one unique feature which will be available for use with Geonodes is the concept of scarcity.
A location, such as Central Park, which is frequented by millions of people every year, might yield very little in the way of XP rains.
However, a location which is almost never visited would be permitted to accumulate a much more extensive store of XP, which would correspond to how much work is needed to reach the Geonode.
The first person to unfurl an XP flag on the summit of Mount Everest and access the Geonode there,
would undoubtedly receive a fantastic reward, both regarding actual human experience and XP.

Meet New York City – another unique feature that would support
Geonode distribution is the use of “GeoDrops.” These drops would enable users or a company to to establish XP Drop Points at any point geographically where they could be displayed on a map, bringing members of the XP community into range to attempt to collect the XP.
In terms of market sizing, this has the potential to make Pokemon Go, which has revenues of $268 million as of August 12th, 201710, look tiny by comparison.
