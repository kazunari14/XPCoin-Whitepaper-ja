### XP Supernodes (Cost: 1b XP)
XP understands that people would like to gain higher returns for the service of securing the network and keeping tokens out of circulation.
In light of this, we will be creating the XP Supernode. This node will require a much higher initial deposit, but will stake at a much higher rate.
In exchange for this higher staking rate, there will be a one-week delay before the node can be broken.
Furthermore, the creation of a supernode will result in a permanent burn of the coins used to establish the node.
While it will still receive roughly 200% of the initial 1 billion XP deposit annually, the first billion has been destroyed.
This means that after the purchase of the Supernode,
it will take roughly six months to be able to break the node without losing a percentage of funds.
These two innovations will prevent the opportunistic dumping of high token volumes when price targets are reached.
This feature will essentially limit Supernodes to those who believe in the project and are willing to support it with their continual service of network security.

### XP Salesnodes
In order to grow the XP network, it is necessary to bring merchants willing to both accept XP and provide XP to their customers.
This is vital to onboarding new users and introducing them to the XP economy.
This simple economic reality necessitates the creation of the Retail Salesnode.
The vast majority of people spending money today are not familiar with cryptocurrency in any meaningful sense.
Certainly, they have heard about various cryptocurrency projects, but cryptocurrency has a magical unreality to it.
In order to facilitate the spread of the XP economy,
the XP Foundation will create and distribute XP Salesnodes to retailers/shopowners who would like to either accept XP or to use it for promotional purposes.
The Salesnode will function exactly like a Masternode with one critical difference
– while a Masternode can be broken up and sold at its holder’s whim or transferred, a Salesnode cannot be broken up or sold.
The stake rewards from this node can be used promotionally, as rains, or in any way that the merchant can devise.
However, it will only stake to 150% of the initial deposit.
This prevents a dormant or lightly used Salesnode from continuing to stake when not being used.
The Salesnode itself also serves as a point-of-sale integration system,
allowing the main wallet to be used just as a normal wallet for sales purposes, keeping the staking portion of the node segregated from the daily balance for usage.
In the event that the merchant decides to no longer participate in the XP network, the coins will be functionally burnt and can be removed from the total supply.
In fact, the creation of the sales node, for all intents and purposes, functions as a coin burn.
This means that for every single merchant partner that joins the XP network, the total coin supply is reduced by a set number, while the security of the network is maintained.
This will mean that there can be a DIRECT correlation between merchant signups and market price.
